# ☁️ Cloud Internship - Task 2: Launch a Virtual Machine (VM Instance)

## 🎯 Objective
To understand how **cloud virtual machines** work by creating, configuring, and connecting to a cloud-based server instance using the **Google Cloud Free Tier** platform.

This task demonstrates **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)** — the foundation of all cloud operations.
